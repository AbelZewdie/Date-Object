# `Date-Object`

## Definition:
The date object is a built-in javascript object that provides several methods for `managing, manipulating and formmating dates and times.`

## Key Points:
To work with the `date object`, we need to first create an instance of the date object by using the `new operator`.

`There are 4 ways to create a new date-object` depending on we want the current date and time or a custom one. 

We can use the `.toLocalString` method to get the actual names of the `months` and `days`.

## Month and day are both zero indexed
`For the month:` January is 0 and February is 1.

`For the day:` Sunday is 0 and Monday is 1.


## Get methods and set methods:
`Get methods:` enables us to retrieve different components of date and time. For example, the year, the hour or the second.

`set methods:` allow us to set them.
